# P!NG Quick Start Guide

## Install & Activate

1. **Install** the plugin by running the `.pkg` installer. It installs to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/` (AU and VST3).
2. **Restart** your DAW (Logic Pro, Ableton, etc.) so it detects P!NG.
3. **Activate** on first use: enter your name and serial number in the activation window, then click **Activate**.

## IR Folder

P!NG loads impulse responses from:

**`~/Documents/P!NG/IRs`**  
(Create this folder and add `.wav` or `.aiff` files if it’s empty.)

---

## Main Workflow

1. **Insert** P!NG on a track or aux.
2. **Choose an IR** from the dropdown next to the waveform (or select **Synthesized IR** if you’ve just created one).
3. **Adjust Dry/Wet** – the main mix between dry and wet signal.
4. **Use Predelay, Damping, Width** and other controls to shape the reverb.
5. **Save presets** from the preset menu to recall your favourite settings.

## IR Synthesiser (Build Your Own IRs)

1. Click **IR Synth** to open the synthesiser.
2. Use the **Placement** tab to set room shape, size, and move speaker/mic pucks on the floor plan.
3. Use the **Character** tab to pick floor, ceiling, and wall materials, plus diffusion, audience, vault type, etc.
4. Click **Preview** to render and hear the IR. Stay on the synth page to tweak.
5. When satisfied, type a name and click **Save** – the IR is saved to the IR folder and appears in both lists.
6. Click **Done** to return to the main UI with your new IR active.

## Tips

- **Reverse** flips the IR in time; useful for preverb-style effects.
- **Early Reflections** and **Tail** sliders balance the early and late parts of the IR.
- **EQ** at the bottom shapes the reverb tone – drag bands on the graph or use band 1/2/3.
- Presets store IR choice, synth params, and all main controls.
